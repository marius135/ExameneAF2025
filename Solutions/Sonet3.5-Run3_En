Task 1: Bipartite Subgraph
Let's find a maximum connected bipartite induced subgraph.

For Graph_1_6, let's try to find the largest possible bipartite subgraph:

1. After analysis, the largest bipartite induced subgraph contains nodes {4,5,8,9,7}
2. Bipartition:
   - Set A: {4,8}
   - Set B: {5,7,9}

This is bipartite because:
- All edges connect vertices between sets (never within same set)
- Connected via path 4-8-9-7 and 4-5
- It's maximal (adding any other vertex would break bipartiteness)

Task 2: BFS from vertex 4

Let me demonstrate the BFS(4) process:

1. Initial: Queue = [4], Visited = {4}
2. Process 4:
   - Add neighbors {3,5,8} to queue
   - Queue = [3,5,8], Visited = {4,3,5,8}
3. Process 3:
   - Add neighbors {1,2,6} to queue
   - Queue = [5,8,1,2,6], Visited = {4,3,5,8,1,2,6}
4. Process remaining vertices

Distances from 4:
- d(4,4) = 0
- d(4,3) = d(4,5) = d(4,8) = 1
- d(4,1) = d(4,2) = d(4,6) = d(4,9) = 2
- d(4,7) = 3

BFS Tree:
```
       4
    /  |  \
   3   5   8
 / | \     |
1  2  6    9
           |
           7

Task 3: Eulerian Path

First, let's check if the graph has an Eulerian path. For an undirected graph to have an Eulerian path:
- Either all vertices must have even degree, or
- Exactly two vertices must have odd degree (these will be the endpoints)

Let's count degrees:
1: deg(1) = 2
2: deg(2) = 3
3: deg(3) = 5
4: deg(4) = 3
5: deg(5) = 2
6: deg(6) = 2
7: deg(7) = 2
8: deg(8) = 3
9: deg(9) = 2

We have 5 vertices with odd degree (2,3,4,8), so the graph doesn't have an Eulerian path.

To make it have an Eulerian path, we need to remove edges to leave exactly 2 vertices with odd degree. Minimum number of edges to remove: 1

Strategy: Remove edge (3,4) which connects two odd-degree vertices. After removal:
- Vertex 3 becomes even degree (4)
- Vertex 4 becomes even degree (2)
- Only vertices 2 and 8 remain with odd degree

Now an Eulerian path exists from vertex 2 to vertex 8:
2 - 1 - 3 - 5 - 4 - 8 - 7 - 9 - 8 - 2 - 6 - 3

Task 4: Critical Nodes

A critical node (articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components.

Algorithm to find critical nodes:
1. Run DFS to build DFS tree
2. For each vertex v, compute:
   - disc[v]: discovery time
   - low[v]: lowest discovery time reachable from subtree
3. Vertex v is critical if either:
   - Root of DFS tree with multiple children
   - Non-root vertex where low[w] ≥ disc[v] for some child w

In our graph, critical nodes are: {3, 8}
- Removing 3 disconnects vertices 1,2,6 from the rest
- Removing 8 disconnects vertices 7,9 from the rest

Task 5: Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

The missing line in the algorithm is:
```
if D[i,k] + D[k,j] < D[i,j] then
    D[i,j] = D[i,k] + D[k,j]
```

For j=1:
```
Initial D matrix (showing changes):
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
1 0  1  4  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞
2 1  0  2  ∞  ∞  10 ∞  ∞  ∞
3 4  2  0  5  12 11 ∞  ∞  ∞
4 ∞  ∞  5  0  1  ∞  ∞  3  ∞
5 ∞  ∞  12 1  0  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞
6 ∞  10 11 ∞  ∞  0  ∞  ∞  ∞
7 ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  0  2  5
8 ∞  ∞  ∞  3  ∞  ∞  2  0  6
9 ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  5  6  0
```

Only initial direct edges are shown. As we progress through j=2 and j=3, the algorithm will update distances through intermediate vertices.


Task 6: Prim's Algorithm starting from vertex 4

Let's execute Prim's algorithm:
1. Start with vertex 4
2. Add cheapest edge connecting to unvisited vertex: 4-5 (w=1)
3. From vertices {4,5}, add 4-8 (w=3)
4. From vertices {4,5,8}, add 8-7 (w=2)
5. From vertices {4,5,8,7}, add 8-9 (w=6)
6. From vertices {4,5,8,7,9}, add 4-3 (w=5)
7. From vertices {4,5,8,7,9,3}, add 3-2 (w=2)
8. Finally add 2-1 (w=1)

Final MST edges: (4,5), (4,8), (8,7), (8,9), (4,3), (3,2), (2,1)
Total weight: 20

Task 7: MST Algorithm Correctness

The given algorithm is NOT correct. Here's why:

1. Consider a graph where vertex 1 is not in the optimal MST
2. The algorithm forces using edges connected to vertex 1 in its first iteration
3. Counterexample: A triangle with vertices {1,2,3} and weights:
   - (1,2): 10
   - (2,3): 1
   - (1,3): 5
   The algorithm would choose edge (1,2) or (1,3) in first iteration, but optimal MST only contains (2,3)

Task 8: Ford-Fulkerson (Edmonds-Karp) Algorithm

Starting from given flow, let's find augmenting paths:

1. First path: 1-5-4-2-6-7
   - Minimum residual capacity = 3
   - New flow: Update along path

2. Second path: 1-5-3-7
   - Minimum residual capacity = 3
   - New flow: Update along path

3. No more augmenting paths exist

Minimum cut:
- S = {1,5}
- T = {2,3,4,6,7}
- Forward edges: (1,2), (5,3), (5,4)
- Backward edges: none
Cut capacity = sum of capacities = 5 + 6 + 0 = 11

Task 9: Graph Theory Proofs

a) Proof that d(x) ≥ n/2 implies connectivity:
- Suppose graph is not connected
- Take two components C1 and C2
- Any vertex x in C1 can only connect to vertices in C1
- So d(x) ≤ |C1| - 1 < n/2
- Contradicts given condition
- Therefore graph must be connected

b) Non-Hamiltonian graph example:
- Take K2,3 (complete bipartite)
- Two vertices in one partition with degree 3 each
- Sum of degrees = 6 > 5 = n
- Not Hamiltonian due to bipartite structure

c) Proof for m ≥ C(n-1,2) + 2 implies Hamiltonian:
- By contradiction
- If not Hamiltonian, by Bondy-Chvátal theorem
- Maximum possible edges while remaining non-Hamiltonian is C(n-1,2) + 1
- But given m ≥ C(n-1,2) + 2
- Contradiction, therefore must be Hamiltonian

Task 10: Longest Common Subsequence

For "cerceta" and "retea":

Dynamic programming matrix:
```
    r  e  t  e  a
c   0  0  0  0  0
e   0  1  1  1  1
r   1  1  1  1  1
c   1  1  1  1  1
e   1  2  2  2  2
t   1  2  3  3  3
a   1  2  3  3  4
```

Formula: dp[i][j] = 
- if chars match: 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
- else: max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

LCS length = 4 ("etea")

Task 11: Mine Explorer Algorithm

We can solve this using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm:


def find_path(chambers, tunnels, start, end):
    n = len(chambers)
    dynamite = {i: float('inf') for i in chambers}
    dynamite[start] = 0
    prev = {i: None for i in chambers}
    pq = [(0, start)]
    
    while pq:
        d, current = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if current == end:
            break
            
        if d > dynamite[current]:
            continue
            
        for next_chamber, needs_dynamite in tunnels[current]:
            new_dynamite = dynamite[current] + needs_dynamite
            
            if new_dynamite < dynamite[next_chamber]:
                dynamite[next_chamber] = new_dynamite
                prev[next_chamber] = current
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dynamite, next_chamber))
                
    if dynamite[end] == float('inf'):
        return None
        
    path = []
    current = end
    while current:
        path.append(current)
        current = prev[current]
    return path[::-1]
```

Complexity: O((E + V)log V) where E is number of tunnels and V is number of chambers

This algorithm:
1. Uses priority queue to always explore path using minimum dynamite
2. Updates dynamite needed when finding better paths
3. Reconstructs optimal path using prev pointers
4. Returns None if no path exists
