Task 1: Bipartite Subgraph (5 points)

Explanation: A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets (U and V) such that every edge connects a vertex in U to a vertex in V. The goal is to find the largest connected induced subgraph that is bipartite.

Algorithm: I will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) based coloring approach.

Start with an arbitrary vertex and assign it to one set (e.g., U).

Explore the graph using BFS, assigning neighbors to the opposite set.

If during BFS, we encounter a conflict (a neighbor already belongs to the same set), the graph is not bipartite. In this case, we need to remove vertices to make it bipartite. A simple strategy is to remove the vertex that caused the conflict.

Repeat the process until a bipartite subgraph is found.

Solution:

Starting with vertex "1" in set U = {"1"}.

Neighbors of "1" are "2" and "3". Add them to set V = {"2", "3"}.
Now we have U = {"1"}, V = {"2", "3"}.

Neighbors of "2" are "1" (already assigned), "3" (already assigned), and "6". Add "6" to U. U = {"1", "6"}, V = {"2", "3"}

Neighbors of "3" are "1" (already assigned), "2" (already assigned), "4", "5", and "6" (already assigned). Add "4" and "5" to V. V = {"2", "3", "4", "5"}
Now we have U = {"1", "6"}, V = {"2", "3", "4", "5"}

The Graph {1,2,3,4,5,6} is not bipartite because of the edge between {3,6} both exist on the V side. We can remove node 6.

The nodes {1,2,3,4,5} is still not bipartite.

The graph {1, 2, 4, 5}
Set U {1,4} Set V{2,5}.
Nodes that are part of the graph and can be divided into disjoint sets are U{1,4},V{2,5} but this only contains 4 nodes.

A maximal connected bipartite induced subgraph with nodes {1, 2, 4, 5} and edges (1,2), (4,5)

Let's start with vertex "4"
Neighbor nodes 3,5,8.
U = {4}
V = {3,5,8}
Neighbor of 3 = 1,2,4,5,6, remove Node 4
Neighbor of 5 = 3,4, remove Node 4
Neighbor of 8 = 4, 7, 9, remove Node 4

New Partitions:
U = {}
V = {}

Since {1, 2, 4, 5}, graph is not connected.
Another example graph is {4,5} since no edge can make the graph connected.

Let's try to remove node 3 and node 6 since it is not a bipartite subgraph and not connected.
U = {1,4,7,9}
V = {2,5,8}

Connected nodes from U-> V: {1,2,5,7,8,9}
A maximal connected bipartite induced subgraph with nodes {1, 2, 4, 5,7,8,9} and edges (1,2), (4,5)

Since 4,5 does not connect the graph to vertex 7,8,9
Starting with vertex 4 for U node with neighboring node.

Connected graph {4,7,8,9}
U = {4,7,9}
V = {8}

Another connected graph {1,2} since (1,2) connects to other neighbors.
Connected graph {1,2}
U = {1}
V = {2}

Final Answer: I apologize for the long execution, the solution of {1, 2, 4, 5,7,8,9} is not an induced subgraph. There can be multiple answers to this and the possible values to the induced subgraph can be U = {4,7,9} and V = {8} to form the nodes {4,7,8,9}.

Task 2: Breadth-First Search (BFS) (5 points)

Explanation: BFS explores a graph level by level, finding the shortest path (in terms of edge count) from a source node to all other reachable nodes.

Algorithm:

Initialize distance[i] to infinity for all nodes i, and distance[4] = 0 (starting node).

Initialize a queue Q = {4}.

While Q is not empty:

Dequeue u from Q.

For each neighbor v of u (in lexicographical order):

If distance[v] is infinity:

distance[v] = distance[u] + 1

Enqueue v into Q

Solution:

Q = {4}, distances = {1: inf, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: 0, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: inf}

Task 3: Eulerian Path (7.5 points)

Explanation: An Eulerian path exists if a graph is connected and has at most two vertices of odd degree. If all vertices have even degree, there is an Eulerian circuit.

Algorithm:

Calculate the degree of each vertex.

If more than two vertices have odd degree, remove edges to reduce the number of odd-degree vertices to 0 or 2. Minimize the number of removed edges.

Find an Eulerian path (or circuit) in the resulting graph.

Four vertices (2, 3, 4, 8) have odd degree. Remove edges (2, 3) and (4,8) to make all vertices have even degree.

Now degrees are: 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9: 2

The graph now has an Eulerian circuit. One possible circuit (starting from node 1) is: 1-2-6-3-1-3-5-4-3-6-7-8-9-7-8-5

Necessary and Sufficient Condition: An undirected graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected, and either 0 or 2 vertices have odd degree. If 0 vertices have odd degree, it has an Eulerian circuit.

Task 4: Critical Nodes (Articulation Points) (7.5 points)

Explanation: A critical node (or articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components.

Algorithm (Tarjan's Algorithm - DFS based):

Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS).

Maintain disc[u] (discovery time of node u) and low[u] (lowest discovery time reachable from u or its descendants using at most one back edge).

During DFS:

disc[u] = low[u] = current_time

For each neighbor v of u:

If v is not visited:

parent[v] = u

Recursively call DFS on v.

low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

Articulation Point Conditions:

If u is the root and has more than one child in the DFS tree, u is an articulation point.

If u is not the root and low[v] >= disc[u], then u is an articulation point.

Else if v is not the parent of u (back edge):

low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])

Solution:

Starting DFS from vertex 1:

DFS(1): disc[1] = 1, low[1] = 1
    DFS(2): disc[2] = 2, low[2] = 2, parent[2] = 1
        DFS(6): disc[6] = 3, low[6] = 3, parent[6] = 2
            DFS(3): disc[3] = 4, low[3] = 4, parent[3] = 6
                DFS(4): disc[4] = 5, low[4] = 5, parent[4] = 3
                    DFS(5): disc[5] = 6, low[5] = 6, parent[5] = 4
                        low[5] = min(low[5], disc[3]) = 4  // Back edge 5-3
                    DFS(8): disc[8] = 7, low[8] = 7, parent[8] = 4
                        DFS(7): disc[7] = 8, low[7] = 8, parent[7] = 8
                            DFS(9): disc[9] = 9, low[9] = 9, parent[9] = 8
                                low[9] = min(low[9], disc[7]) = 8  // Back edge 9-7
                                low[9] = min(low[9], disc[8]) = 7  // Back edge 9-8
                            low[7] = min(low[7], low[9]) = 7
                        low[8] = min(low[8], disc[4]) = 5  // Back edge 8-4
                        low[8] = min(low[8], low[7]) = 7
                    low[4] = min(low[4], disc[3]) = 4  // Back edge 4-3
                    low[4] = min(low[4], low[5]) = 4
                    low[4] = min(low[4], low[8]) = 5
                low[3] = min(low[3], disc[1]) = 1  // Back edge 3-1
                low[3] = min(low[3], disc[2]) = 2  // Back edge 3-2
                low[3] = min(low[3], disc[6]) = 3  // Back edge 3-6
                low[3] = min(low[3], low[4]) = 4

Identifying Articulation Points:

1 (Root): 1 has only one child in the DFS tree (2). Therefore, 1 is not an articulation point.

2: Child is 6. low[6] (3) >= disc[2] (2) is false, child cannot reach above 2 and will cause separation if node 2 is removed, so 2 is not an articulation point.

6: Child is 3. low[3] (4) >= disc[6] (3) is false.

3: Child is 4. low[4] (5) >= disc[3] (4) is false.

4: Child is 5. low[5] (6) >= disc[4] (5) is false.

5: No Children

8: No Children

7: No Children

Critical Nodes: NONE.

While T has fewer than n-1 edges:

Find the minimum-weight edge connecting a vertex in T to a vertex not in T.

Add that edge and the vertex it connects to T.

Solution:

Minimum: (8,7,2)

T = {4, 5, 8, 7}, edges = {(4, 5), (4, 8), (8, 7)}

Iteration 4:

Final MST: Edges: {(4, 5), (4, 8), (8, 7), (4,3), (3,2), (2,1), (7,9), (6,2)}. Total weight = 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 10 = 29

Task 7: MST Algorithm Correctness (5 points)

    2. Choose an edge of minimum cost e with one end in C and the other not and add e to T

Use code with caution.

Correctness Justification:

The algorithm is correct and builds an MST. It relies on the Cut Property of MSTs.

Cut Property: For any cut (partition of the vertices into two non-empty sets) of a connected graph, the minimum-weight edge crossing the cut must be in every MST.

Proof:

Spanning Tree: The algorithm maintains a tree (a connected, acyclic graph) at each step.

Initially, T is empty (just vertices).

In each iteration, we add an edge that connects a connected component C to a vertex outside of C. This guarantees no cycles are formed.

After |V|-1 iterations, T will have |V|-1 edges and connect all vertices, forming a spanning tree.

Minimality: The key is to show the constructed spanning tree is minimal. Consider what happen in every single iterations in 1 to |V|-1,

Since every vertices was touched from 1 to |V|-1, then we can prove the whole graph is spanning.

There exists no other route that is smaller than each route that each vertex is chosen in 1 to |V|-1. Then this is an MST.

Task 8: Ford-Fulkerson and Minimum Cut (12.5 points)

Algorithm (Edmonds-Karp):

Initialize flow f(e) = 0 for all edges.

While there exists an augmenting path p from s to t (found using BFS):

Find the bottleneck capacity c_f(p) = min{c(u, v) - f(u, v) : (u, v) in p}

For each edge (u, v) in p:

f(u, v) = f(u, v) + c_f(p)

f(v, u) = f(v, u) - c_f(p) (Update reverse flow)

Find the Minimum Cut:

After the algorithm terminates, perform a BFS in the residual graph starting from s.

S = vertices reachable from s.

T = V - S.

The minimum cut consists of edges from S to T in the original graph. The capacity of the cut is the sum of capacities of those edges.

Solution:

Starting with the initial flow shown in the diagram, the solution is as following steps:

After analyzing path 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 7: The max bottleneck can be 5, which is the limit from 1 -> 2. Thus, flow: 1 -> 2 =10, 2 -> 6 = 8, 6 -> 7=8

After analyzing path 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 7: Path has max flow = 6, which is the max of flow 1->5, path has max flow 3, which is max of flow 3 -> 7

No further path can be created in the graph, therefore, maximum flow is all paths summed which equals 6

Minimum Cut:

From source node 1, it can traverse to:
2,3,4,5,6

Since from previous results, all nodes have bottleneck of 0, which terminates algorithm, thus, all those nodes can reach the destination, and that's the optimal result. Therefore node 7 is the bottleneck which is the minimum cut

S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

T = {7}

Min Cut = 11, (1,2) is full, so, total cap is from node 1 = 1->5 + 1-> 2 = 6+ 5=11

Justification:

Edmonds-Karp guarantees termination and finds the maximum flow.

The Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem guarantees that the maximum flow equals the minimum cut capacity.

Task 9: Graph Theory Proofs (15 points)

(a) d(x) >= n/2 implies connectedness

Proof by Contradiction:

Assume the graph is not connected.

It must have at least two connected components, C1 and C2.

Let n1 be the number of nodes in C1, and n2 in C2. n1 + n2 <= n.

Consider node x in C1. Its degree d(x) <= n1 - 1.

We know d(x) >= n/2. Thus, n/2 <= n1 - 1, implying n <= 2n1 - 2.

Since it disconnected from C2, there must be one vertice in C1 is greater or equal to the graph, so then n1 >= n, thus C2 will be 0,

** (b) Non-Hamiltonian graph with two non-adjacent nodes, d(u) + d(v) >= n**

V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
The edges are:

1 is connected to 2,3,4, thus the neighbor are 2,3,4

2 is connected to 1,3,4, thus the neighbor are 1,3,4

3 is connected to 1,2,5, thus the neighbor are 1,2,5

4 is connected to 1,2

5 is connected to 3,4, thus the neighbor are 3,4

Degrees: d(1) = 3, d(2) = 3, d(3) = 3, d(4) = 3, d(5) = 2.
Nodes 1 and 5 are non-adjacent, d(1) + d(5) = 3 + 2 = 5 >= n.

The graph is not Hamiltonian. There is no loop to connect every single node. This is because if a Hamitonian graph has the degrees >= n, then adding an edge to any non hamiltonian graph will violate the condition because adding degree will have larger than 5 number of edges since degrees are more than 5.

(c) m >= combinations(n-1, 2) + 2 edges implies Hamiltonian

Proof:  This is actually **incorrect**.  The correct condition is `m >= combinations(n-1, 2) + 2`.  I will prove *this* correct condition.

Proof by Contradiction:

1.  Assume G is not Hamiltonian.
2.  We want to show that if G is not Hamiltonian, it *cannot* have m >= C(n-1, 2) + 2 edges.  In other words, if it's not Hamiltonian, it *must* have *fewer* than C(n-1,2) + 2 edges.

If G is not a complete bipartite graph, then G should be non-hamitonian. So the smallest size of the graph that it will have:

If the graph contains two or more disconnected components, then the number of edges would always be smaller.
Consider the smallest possible graph which is non-hamiltonian, and for any edge, adding it will create a hamiltonian graph. We start with a complete graph of size n-1, and node n is disconnected from any node. Then the number of edges are (n-1)(n-2)/2. Adding two or more edges will make this graph hamiltonian and the smallest of graph, n >= (n-1)(n-2)/2+ 2.

Completing the Proof.
If G is not hamiltonian, d(u) + d(v) < n. We can say d(u) + d(v) <= n-1.
The theorem will be proven if we show if G does not have >= (n-1)(n-2)/2 + 2, it is not hamitonian.
Consider the smallest possible graph which is non-hamiltonian, and for any edge, adding it will create a hamiltonian graph. We start with a complete graph of size n-1, and node n is disconnected from any node. Then the number of edges are (n-1)(n-2)/2. Adding more edges will make this graph hamiltonian.
If the graph contains two or more disconnected components, then the number of edges would always be smaller.
This shows that if the number of edges > (n-1)(n-2)/2 +1 then the graph is hamiltonian.
So the number of edges should be at least (n-1)(n-2)/2 + 2

**Task 10: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) (7.5 points)**

**Explanation:** Find the longest subsequence common to two sequences.

**Algorithm (Dynamic Programming):**

1.  Let `X` and `Y` be the two sequences of length `m` and `n` respectively.
2.  Create a table `LCS[0...m][0...n]`.
3.  Initialize `LCS[i][0] = 0` and `LCS[0][j] = 0` for all `i` and `j`.
4.  Fill the table:
    *   If `X[i] == Y[j]`:  `LCS[i][j] = LCS[i-1][j-1] + 1`
    *   Else: `LCS[i][j] = max(LCS[i-1][j], LCS[i][j-1])`
5.  `LCS[m][n]` contains the length of the LCS.

**Solution:**

X = "cerceta", Y = "retea"

**Task 11: Mine Exploration (15 points)**

**Explanation:** Find the shortest path (minimum dynamite usage) from the entrance to the crystal chamber in a directed graph.

**Algorithm (Modified Dijkstra's):**

1.  Represent the mine as a directed graph.  Collapsed chambers require dynamite (weight 1), non-collapsed chambers have weight 0.
2.  Initialize:
    *   `distance[i] = infinity` for all chambers `i`.
    *   `distance[entrance] = 0`.
    *   `priority_queue = {(0, entrance)}` (dynamite cost, chamber ID).
3.  While `priority_queue` is not empty:
    *   `u = priority_queue.extractMin()`
    *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:
        *   `weight = 1 if v is collapsed else 0`
        *   `new_distance = distance[u] + weight`
        *   If `new_distance < distance[v]`:
            *   `distance[v] = new_distance`
            *   `priority_queue.insert((new_distance, v))`
4.  If `distance[crystal_chamber] == infinity`, there's no path.
5.  Reconstruct the path by backtracking using `previous[v]`.

```python
import heapq

def find_shortest_path(graph, collapsed_chambers, entrance_chamber, crystal_chamber):
    distances = {chamber: float('inf') for chamber in graph}
    distances[entrance_chamber] = 0
    pq = [(0, entrance_chamber)] # (cost, node)
    previous = {chamber: None for chamber in graph} # Keep track of path
    while pq:
        cost, u = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if cost > distances[u]: # Lazy deletion
            continue

        if u == crystal_chamber:
            break

        for v in graph[u]:
            weight = 1 if v in collapsed_chambers else 0
            new_cost = cost + weight
            if new_cost < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = new_cost
                previous[v] = u
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, v))

    if distances[crystal_chamber] == float('inf'):
        return "No path"

    # Reconstruct path
    path = []
    curr = crystal_chamber
    while curr is not None:
        path.insert(0, curr)
        curr = previous[curr]

    return path
