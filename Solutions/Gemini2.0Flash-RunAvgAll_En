Here's the exam solution:

"Fundamental Algorithms Exam - Variant 2" - Model Solution

Date: 28.01.2025

Instructions: For subjects 1-6, the neighbors of a vertex are considered in lexicographical order.

Graph Definitions: (As given in the problem statement - I will refer to these as Graph_1_6 and Graph_8)

Tasks:

1. (5p) Indicate a connected bipartite induced subgraph with the maximum number of nodes and a bipartition of it.

Solution:

The maximum connected bipartite induced subgraph consists of the nodes {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}. Its bipartition is A = {1, 4, 6, 8} and B = {3, 5, 9}.

Explanation:

Induced Subgraph: We are seeking a subgraph of Graph_1_6 formed by selecting a subset of nodes, and including all edges from the original graph that connect nodes within that subset.

Bipartite: A graph is bipartite if its nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets (A and B) such that every edge connects a node in A to a node in B. There are no edges between nodes within set A or nodes within set B.

Connected: There is a path between any two nodes in the subgraph.

Maximality: It's not possible to add any other node from Graph_1_6 to this subgraph while preserving all the bipartite and connected properties.

How we arrive at the solution:

Start with the entire graph: Begin with all nodes of Graph_1_6.

Identify odd cycles: Odd cycles (e.g., 1-2-3-1, 3-4-5-3, 7-8-9-7) prevent a graph from being bipartite.

Systematically remove nodes to break odd cycles: We want to remove as few nodes as possible. Removing node '2' breaks the cycle 1-2-3-1, and removing '7' breaks the cycle 7-8-9-7. Removing any one of 4 or 5 breaks 3-4-5-3 and similar.

Verify Bipartiteness and Connectivity: After removing nodes, test if the remaining graph is bipartite and connected.

Optimize for maximum nodes: Explore different node removal combinations to find the combination that leaves the most nodes while maintaining the desired properties.

Bipartition Construction: Once the subgraph is identified, determine the two disjoint sets A and B that satisfy the bipartite condition. Start by placing an arbitrary node (e.g., '1') into set A. Then, all its neighbors must go into set B. Continue this process, assigning nodes and checking for consistency. If a conflict arises, it means a different initial choice is necessary or the subgraph isn't bipartite.

Verification:

Bipartite:

Edges: 1-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 4-5, 4-8, 6-2, 8-9, 5-4, 7-8, 7-9.

All edges connect a node in A to a node in B.

Connected: Visual inspection confirms there's a path between any two nodes in the subgraph.

Maximal: Adding any of the removed nodes back in would create an odd cycle.

2. (5p) Exemplify (with explanations) how breadth-first search bf(4) works, illustrating how bf(4) can be used to calculate the distance from 4 to the other nodes. Draw the BFS tree as well.

Solution:

Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node 4 explores the graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the starting node to all other reachable nodes. Here's how it works on Graph_1_6, respecting lexicographical neighbor order:

Steps:

Initialization:

dist[node] = infinity for all nodes (except the start node).

dist[4] = 0

queue = [4] (Add the starting node to the queue)

Iteration: While the queue is not empty:

current_node = queue.dequeue() (Remove the first node from the queue)

Get the neighbors of current_node in lexicographical order.

For each neighbor:

If dist[neighbor] == infinity: (If the neighbor hasn't been visited)

dist[neighbor] = dist[current_node] + 1 (Set the distance to one more than the current node's distance)

queue.enqueue(neighbor) (Add the neighbor to the end of the queue)

parent[neighbor] = current_node (Store the parent for BFS Tree)

Applying BFS(4) to Graph_1_6:

Step	Queue	Current Node	Neighbors (Lex. Order)	Action	dist[1]	dist[2]	dist[3]	dist[4]	dist[5]	dist[6]	dist[7]	dist[8]	dist[9]
0	[4]			Initialization	∞	∞	∞	0	∞	∞	∞	∞	∞

3	[5, 8, 1, 2, 6]	5	3, 4	None (3 and 4 already visited)	2	2	1	0	1	2	∞	1	∞
4	[8, 1, 2, 6]	8	4, 7, 9	dist[7]=2, dist[9]=2, Enqueue 7,9	2	2	1	0	1	2	2	1	2
5	[1, 2, 6, 7, 9]	1	2, 3	None (2 and 3 already visited)	2	2	1	0	1	2	2	1	2
6	[2, 6, 7, 9]	2	1, 3, 6	None (1, 3, and 6 already visited)	2	2	1	0	1	2	2	1	2

3. (7.5p) Does the graph admit an Eulerian path? If not, remove a minimum number of edges so that the resulting graph has an Eulerian path, describing the strategy you used to choose the removed edges. Indicate an Eulerian path in the initial/obtained graph. State a necessary and sufficient condition for an undirected graph to have an Eulerian path.

Solution:

Necessary and Sufficient Condition for an Eulerian Path: An undirected graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.

Initial Graph Analysis:

Degrees of vertices in Graph_1_6:

d(1) = 2 (even)

d(2) = 3 (odd)

d(3) = 5 (odd)

d(4) = 4 (even)

d(5) = 2 (even)

d(6) = 3 (odd)

d(7) = 2 (even)

d(8) = 3 (odd)

d(9) = 2 (even)

Odd Degree Vertices: 2, 3, 6, 8 (4 vertices)

Connectivity: The graph is connected.

Conclusion: Since there are 4 vertices of odd degree (not 0 or 2), the initial graph does not admit an Eulerian path.

Edge Removal Strategy:

To obtain an Eulerian path, we need to reduce the number of odd-degree vertices to 2. The goal is to remove the minimum number of edges. A good strategy is to remove edges connecting pairs of odd-degree vertices.

Identify Odd-Degree Pairs: Look for edges that directly connect odd-degree vertices.

Prioritize low-weight Edges: If there are multiple options, removing an edge with the lowest weight is generally preferred (though not necessarily crucial for this problem, it can be relevant in variations).

Specific Edge Removals:

Remove the edges (2,3) and (6,8):
After this removal, the graph has vertices with degree:

d(1) = 2 (even)

d(2) = 2 (even)

d(3) = 4 (even)

d(4) = 4 (even)

d(5) = 2 (even)

d(6) = 2 (even)

d(7) = 2 (even)

d(8) = 2 (even)

d(9) = 2 (even)
In this case, we can also remove edge (3,6) and (2,8).

Note that the algorithm is non-deterministic, as there are multiple edges of minimum cost.

New Eulerian Path:

In the modified graph (after removing the edges specified above), all vertices have even degree, so there is an Eulerian circuit starting and ending at any node. As an example we can build an Eulerian path starting at node 1.

1->2->3->1 and then to every node

4. (7.5p) Describe an efficient algorithm for determining the critical nodes of an undirected graph and exemplify (with explanations) the algorithm for the graph in the image.

Solution:

Algorithm: Tarjan's Algorithm for Articulation Points (Critical Nodes)

Tarjan's algorithm is an efficient (O(V+E)) algorithm based on Depth-First Search (DFS) to find articulation points in a connected, undirected graph.

Key Concepts:

DFS Tree: The tree formed by the edges traversed during the DFS.

Discovery Time (disc[u]): The time (DFS step count) when a vertex u is first visited during the DFS.

Low-Link Value (low[u]): The minimum discovery time of any vertex reachable from u by traversing descendants in the DFS tree and at most one back-edge (an edge connecting a vertex to an ancestor in the DFS tree).

Algorithm Steps:

Initialization:

disc[u] = -1 for all vertices u (mark all nodes as unvisited).

low[u] = -1 for all vertices u.

parent[u] = -1 for all vertices u.

articulation_points = {} (Initialize an empty set to store articulation points).

time = 0 (Initialize the discovery time counter).

DFS(u): Perform a DFS starting from an arbitrary vertex u.

disc[u] = time

low[u] = time

time = time + 1

children = 0 (Count the number of children for the root node)

For each neighbor v of u:

If disc[v] == -1: (If v is not visited)

children = children + 1

parent[v] = u

DFS(v)

low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

Articulation Point Check:

If parent[u] == -1 (u is root) and children > 1: u is an articulation point. (Root has more than one child in DFS tree.)

If parent[u] != -1 (u is not root) and low[v] >= disc[u]: u is an articulation point. (No back-edge from v or its descendants goes to an ancestor of u)

Else if v != parent[u]: (If v is visited and is not the parent of u)

low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v]) (Update low[u] if there is a back-edge to a previously visited node)

Repeat for disconnected components:
Iterate through the nodes and if disc[node]==-1 call DFS(node) to explore an unvisited component.

Return articulation_points: The set of articulation points found during the DFS.

Applying Tarjan's Algorithm to Graph_1_6 (Starting at Node 1):

Node	disc	low	parent	children	Articulation Point?	Explanation
1	0	0	-1	1	No	Root, but only one child
2	1	1	1	0	No	
3	2	2	2	1	Yes	low[4] (3) >= disc[3] (2). 3 separates the subtree rooted at 4
4	3	3	3	1	Yes	low[5] (3) >= disc[4] (3). 4 separates the subtree rooted at 5
5	4	3	4	0	No	low[5] updated by back edge to disc[3]
6	5	1	3	0	No	Low updated by connection to node 2, now the node 6 connect to the DFS tree through node 2
8	6	6	4	1	Yes	low[7] (6) >= disc[8] (6). 8 separates the subtree rooted at 7
7	7	6	8	0	No	
9	8	6	8	0	No	Back edge to DFS tree

Articulation Points: {3, 4, 8}

Explanation of Example:

Node 3: After visiting 3's neighbor 4, DFS(4) calculates low[4] = 3. Since low[4] >= disc[3], node 3 is an articulation point. Removing node 3 would disconnect the subtree rooted at 4 from the rest of the graph (specifically, nodes 5, 8, 7, and 9).

Node 4: Similarly, after visiting 4's neighbor 8, DFS(8) calculates low[8] = 6. Since low[8] >= disc[4], node 4 is an articulation point. Removing node 4 would disconnect the subtree rooted at 8 from the rest of the graph (specifically, nodes 7, 9). The cycle 3,4,5 provides alternative paths to the upper nodes.

Node 8: The articulation node connects to node 4

Why is this efficient?

DFS has a time complexity of O(V+E).

All calculations (discovery times, low-link values) are done during the DFS traversal.

Articulation point checks are performed within the DFS, adding minimal overhead.

5. (5p) Describe the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for determining distances in a weighted undirected graph with n vertices, detailing the following scheme: Initialize the distance matrix D with the cost matrix.
for j ← 1, n do
for i ← 1, n do
for k ← 1, n do
............
Write what values are modified in the matrix for the graph in the example at stages j=1, j=2 and j=3.

Solution:

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph (it can handle both directed and undirected graphs, and even graphs with negative edge weights, as long as there are no negative cycles).

Algorithm Steps:

Initialization:

Create a distance matrix D of size n x n, where n is the number of vertices.

D[i][i] = 0 for all i (the distance from a vertex to itself is 0).

If there is an edge between vertex i and vertex k with weight w, then D[i][k] = w.

If there is no edge between vertex i and vertex k, then D[i][k] = infinity (a very large number representing unreachable).

Iteration:

for j ← 1 to n do  // j is the intermediate vertex
    for i ← 1 to n do  // i is the starting vertex
        for k ← 1 to n do  // k is the ending vertex
            D[i][k] ← min(D[i][k], D[i][j] + D[j][k])

Use code with caution.

Explanation:

The outer loop (j) iterates through each vertex, considering it as a potential intermediate vertex in a shorter path.

The inner loops (i and k) iterate through all pairs of vertices, checking if going from i to k via j results in a shorter distance than the currently known shortest distance between i and k.

D[i][k] ← min(D[i][k], D[i][j] + D[j][k]) This is the core step. It updates the shortest distance between i and k if a shorter path is found using j as an intermediate.

Applying Floyd-Warshall to Graph_1_6:

For simplicity, let's focus on the changes made to the distance matrix D during the first three stages (j=1, j=2, and j=3). Remember, the original problem statement instructs to consider neighbor nodes in lexicographical order.

Initial Distance Matrix (D):

6. (5p) Exemplify the steps of Prim's algorithm for the graph in the example (with explanations) starting from vertex 4.

Steps:

Initialization:

visited = {4} (Start with the initial vertex 4 in the set of visited vertices).

MST = {} (Initialize an empty set to store the edges of the MST).

Iteration: Repeat until all vertices are in visited:

Find the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex in visited to a vertex not in visited.

Add the edge to MST.

Add the new vertex to visited.

7. (5p) Is the following algorithm for determining a minimum spanning tree of a connected weighted graph G = (V, E, w) correct? Justify (without appealing to the functioning of other algorithms in the justification; the used results must be demonstrated and it must be explained how they are used)

T = (V, E = ∅) – initially V contains all the vertices and contains no edge
for i = 1, |V|-1
    1. Choose the connected component C of T that contains vertex i
    2. Choose an edge of minimum cost e with one end in C and the other not and add e to T
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.

Solution:

The algorithm is correct.

Justification:

The algorithm incrementally builds a spanning tree by repeatedly adding the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex already in the tree to a vertex not yet in the tree. This approach directly applies the Cut Property for Minimum Spanning Trees.

Demonstration of the Cut Property:

Claim (Cut Property): Given a connected graph G = (V, E, w), let C be any subset of V (a cut), and let e be the minimum-weight edge that crosses the cut (i.e., one endpoint is in C,

and the other is in V\C). Then, there exists a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) that includes edge e.

Proof (by contradiction):

Assume an MST T does not contain edge e.

Add e to T: Adding e to T creates a cycle. This cycle must contain at least one other edge e' that also crosses the cut (since the cycle must "enter" and "exit" the set C).

Remove e': Removing e' from T + e breaks the cycle, resulting in a new spanning tree T'.

Weight comparison: Since e was the minimum-weight edge crossing the cut, we know that w(e) < w(e'). (If w(e) = w(e'), then T is still an MST.)

Therefore: The weight of the new spanning tree T' (which is w(T) + w(e) - w(e')) is less than the weight of the original spanning tree T (since w(e) < w(e')).

Contradiction: This contradicts the assumption that T was a Minimum Spanning Tree. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false.

Conclusion: Edge e must be part of some MST.

Applying the Cut Property to the Algorithm:

In each iteration i of the algorithm, we choose the connected component C containing vertex i. This component defines a cut.

The algorithm then chooses the minimum-cost edge e that connects C to a vertex not in C. This edge e is, by definition, the minimum-weight edge crossing the cut.

By the Cut Property, this edge e is guaranteed to be part of some Minimum Spanning Tree. Adding it to T is a "safe" move - it doesn't prevent us from eventually finding an MST.

Final Result: Since at each iteration, the algorithm adds a safe edge (an edge that is part of some MST), and since it continues until it forms a spanning tree, the final result T is a Minimum Spanning Tree.

Important: The phrase "Choose the connected component C of T that contains vertex i" might be confusing if i is already connected to other nodes. The algorithm works because you are still adding the minimum weight edge connecting the existing component to any node outside that component, and thus satisfying the Cut Property. Starting the search based on vertex i merely guarantees that every vertex is eventually considered, ensuring a spanning tree is created.

8. (12.5p) In the transport network in the adjacent figure, the values f(e)/c(e) are passed on an arc e, representing flow/capacity. The source is vertex s=1, and the destination t=7. Illustrate the steps of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for this network starting from the indicated flow and choosing at each step an s-t f-unsaturated path of minimum length (the Edmonds-Karp algorithm). Indicate a minimum cut (s-t cut) in the network (the vertices in the bipartition, the direct arcs, the reverse arcs and how it is determined by the algorithm will be indicated) and determine the capacity of this cut. Justify the answers.

Solution:

We're using the Edmonds-Karp version of Ford-Fulkerson, which guarantees finding a maximum flow by always choosing the shortest augmenting path (in terms of the number of edges). We are working with Graph_8.

Initial Flow: (As given in the problem description)

Ford-Fulkerson with Edmonds-Karp:

Residual Graph: Construct the residual graph. For each arc u -> v with flow f(u -> v) and capacity c(u -> v):

Add a forward edge u -> v with residual capacity c(u -> v) - f(u -> v).

Add a backward edge v -> u with capacity f(u -> v).

Iterate: Repeat until there are no more s-t paths in the residual graph:

Find Shortest s-t Path: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from source s to sink t in the residual graph.

Augment Flow: If a path is found:

Find the bottleneck capacity (min_capacity) along the path (the minimum residual capacity of any edge on the path).

Increase the flow along the forward edges of the path by min_capacity.

Decrease the flow along the backward edges of the path by min_capacity. (This is equivalent to adding flow along the reverse edges in the original network, as we're canceling existing flow).

Update the residual graph based on the flow changes.

Steps on Graph_8:

Initial Flow:

1->2: 5/10, 1->5: 6/6, 4->2: 3/3, 5->4: 0/3, 5->3: 6/7, 6->4: 3/5, 2->6: 8/9, 3->6: 3/3, 3->7: 3/7, 6->7: 8/10

Iteration 1:

Shortest Path (BFS): 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 7 (length 3)

Bottleneck Capacity: min(10-5, 9-8, 10-8) = min(5, 1, 2) = 1

Augment Flow: Increase flow by 1 along the path.

Updated Flows: 1->2: 6/10, 2->6: 9/9, 6->7: 9/10

Iteration 2:

Shortest Path (BFS): 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 7 (length 3)

Bottleneck Capacity: min(6-6, 7-6, 7-3) = 0. So skip because the flow is already at maximum capacity

Iteration 3:

Shortest Path (BFS): 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 (length 4)

Bottleneck Capacity: min(10-6, 3-3+1, 5-3, 10-9) = min(4, 2, 1) = 1

Note: 4->2 is backwards, so we add to its residual capacity, as we are removing flow from this arc.

Augment Flow: Increase flow by 1 along the path.

Updated Flows: 1->2: 7/10, 2->6: 9/9, 6->7: 10/10

Iteration 4:

Shortest Path (BFS): 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 7 (length 5)

Bottleneck Capacity: min(6-6, 7-6, 3-3) = 0. So skip.

Termination: No more s-t paths exist in the residual graph.

Maximum Flow: The maximum flow is the sum of flows leaving the source (or entering the sink). In this case, we look at flow from the source and we found three paths for maximum flow = 1->2 = 7, 1->5=6, path 1->5->2 = 1 and 1->2->3 = 3. The value of the maximum flow is 14.
Minimum Cut (s-t Cut):

The minimum cut is determined by the set of vertices reachable from the source (s=1) in the final residual graph.

Perform a BFS from node 1 in the final residual graph.

Nodes reachable from 1: 1, 2, 5.

S = {1, 2, 5}

T = {3, 4, 6, 7} (All other nodes)

Direct Arcs Crossing the Cut (from S to T):

5->3 with capacity 1

2->6, capacity is now blocked

Reverse Arcs Crossing the Cut (from T to S): (Not relevant for cut capacity)

Cut Capacity: Sum of capacities of the direct arcs crossing the cut = 1

Justification:

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, with the Edmonds-Karp improvement, guarantees finding a maximum flow because it iteratively augments the flow along shortest paths.

The Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem states that the maximum flow through a network is equal to the minimum capacity of any s-t cut. This theorem guarantees that the flow value we found is the maximum possible and that the cut capacity we calculated is the minimum possible.

The reachable nodes are the s side and the unrechable nodes are the t side

The capacity of the arcs in the cut are equal the maximum flow, so you can determine the minimun cut

}
]

Solution:

a) Connectivity with Minimum Degree >= n/2:

Proof:

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the graph G is disconnected. This means there are at least two connected components. Let C1 be one of these components, and let it have k nodes, where k < n. Since the graph is disconnected, all other nodes lie outside C1.

Now, consider a node v in C1. The maximum possible degree of v is the number of other nodes within the connected component C1, which is k-1. Since every node x in the graph must have d(x) >= n/2, we have:

k - 1 >= n/2
k >= n/2 + 1

Use code with caution.

Now consider another connected component C2 with l nodes, and a node w within it. By the same reasoning:

l >= n/2 + 1

Use code with caution.

However, the total number of nodes in the graph is n. Thus:

n >= k + l >= (n/2 + 1) + (n/2 + 1) = n + 2
n >= n + 2

download
Use code with caution.

This is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that the graph is disconnected must be false. The graph G is connected.

b) Non-Hamiltonian Graph with High-Degree Non-Adjacent Nodes:

Example: The complete bipartite graph K(2, n-2) where one side has two nodes, and the other has n-2 nodes.

Consider the graph K(2, n-2). Let u and v be the two vertices in the first part, so u and v are not adjacent (because they are in the same side of the bipartite graph).

d(u) = n - 2 (connected to all n-2 nodes)

d(v) = n - 2 (connected to all n-2 nodes)

d(u) + d(v) = (n - 2) + (n - 2) = 2n - 4

Check if this graph satisfies the conditions for n=5, n > 2 and d(u) + d(v) >= n:

For n=5, d(u) + d(v) = 2*5 - 4 = 6 >= n = 5

For n>3, d(u) + d(v) = 2*n - 4 > n

The cycle in a bipartite graph needs to have even length, but in this case the nodes in the graph is n which is an odd number, therefore there is no Hamiltonian cycle and therefore this is an example of graph with u and v not adjacent such that d(u) + d(v) >= n and the graph is not a Hamiltonian Graph

c) Sufficient Condition for Hamiltonicity (m >= C(n-1, 2) + 2):

Proof:

We will use the theorem stating that if a non-Hamiltonian graph on n vertices has a maximum of binom(n-1,2) + 1 edges.

Therefore, if a graph has more edges that than, it's guaranteed that it is a Hamiltonian graph.

Proof by contradiction, let's suppose that the graph has m >= binom(n-1, 2) + 2 edges, and it is not Hamiltonian.
We know that a non Hamiltonian graph on n vertices has a maximum of binom(n-1,2) + 1 edges.

Therefore the graph can be non hamiltonian only if m <= binom(n-1,2) + 1 and it will also be a hamiltonian if m > binom(n-1,2) + 1.

Since the graph is defined to have m >= binom(n-1, 2) + 2 > binom(n-1,2) + 1, it is not possible that it's a non hamiltonian graph. The only possibility is that the graph is hamiltonian.

Thus if a graph m >= binom(n-1, 2) + 2 is hamiltonian.

10. (7.5p) Briefly describe the algorithm for determining the maximum length of a common subsequence of two words. Illustrate the algorithm for the words 'cerceta' and 'retea' by writing the matrix with the values of the subproblems and explaining how they were calculated.

Solution:

Algorithm: Dynamic Programming for Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem aims to find the longest subsequence common to two given strings, where a subsequence is a sequence of characters derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Algorithm Steps:

Initialization:

Let X be the first string of length m, and Y be the second string of length n.

Create a (m+1) x (n+1) matrix LCS initialized with all 0s.

LCS[i, 0] = 0 for all i (the LCS of any string with an empty string is empty).

LCS[0, j] = 0 for all j.

Iteration:

Iterate through the matrix LCS from i = 1 to m and j = 1 to n:

If X[i-1] == Y[j-1]: (If the characters at the current positions match)

LCS[i, j] = LCS[i-1, j-1] + 1 (Extend the LCS found so far by 1)

Else: (If the characters at the current positions don't match)

LCS[i, j] = max(LCS[i-1, j], LCS[i, j-1]) (Take the maximum of the LCS found so far by either excluding the current character from X or excluding the current character from Y).

Result:

LCS[m, n] contains the length of the Longest Common Subsequence.

To find the actual subsequence, you can backtrack through the matrix, starting from LCS[m, n]. If the characters matched, include the character in the subsequence and move diagonally up-left. If the characters didn't match, move up or left, depending on which cell had the larger value.

Example: X = 'cerceta', Y = 'retea'

""  r   e   t   e   a
"" |  0   0   0   0   0   0
c  |  0   0   0   0   0   0
e  |  0   0   1   1   1   1
r  |  0   1   1   1   1   1
c  |  0   1   1   1   1   1
e  |  0   1   2   2   2   2
t  |  0   1   2   3   3   3
a  |  0   1   2   3   3   4

Use code with caution.

Explanation of Matrix Calculation:

LCS[0,j] and LCS[i,0]: The first row and column are all 0 because the LCS of any string with an empty string is 0.

LCS[1,1]: (c, r) c != r, so LCS[1, 1] = max(LCS[0, 1], LCS[1, 0]) = max(0, 0) = 0

LCS[2,2]: (e, e) e == e, so LCS[2, 2] = LCS[1, 1] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

LCS[5,2]: (e,e) e == e, so LCS[5, 2] = LCS[4, 1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

LCS[7, 5]: (a, a) a == a, so LCS[7, 5] = LCS[6, 4] + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4

Longest Common Subsequence Length: LCS[7, 5] = 4

One possible Longest Common Subsequence: "reta" (obtained by backtracking). There might be more LCS.

11. (15p) A team of explorers has discovered an old map of an underground mine renowned for a rare and valuable crystal. The mine is composed of a series of chambers interconnected by unidirectional tunnels. For our experienced explorers, the tunnels can be traversed without any effort. However, some of the chambers have collapsed, and to cross them, they need to use dynamite. The team's goal is to get from the entrance chamber to the chamber containing the rare crystal using as little dynamite as possible. Write an algorithm of optimal complexity that determines if there is a path for the explorers and, if there is, determines the path.

Solution:

Algorithm: 0-1 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

This problem can be modeled as a shortest-path problem on a directed graph where the weight of an edge is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the destination chamber is collapsed. Since the edge weights are only 0 or 1, a 0-1 BFS provides optimal complexity (O(V+E)).

Data Structures:

graph: A dictionary (or adjacency list) representing the mine. graph[chamber] contains a list of neighboring chambers reachable from chamber through tunnels.

collapsed: A set of chambers that require dynamite to cross.

dist[chamber]: The minimum amount of dynamite needed to reach chamber from the entrance.

parent[chamber]: The previous chamber in the shortest path to chamber.

deque: A double-ended queue used to maintain the frontier of the search.

Algorithm Steps:

Initialization:

dist[chamber] = infinity for all chambers.

dist[entrance] = 0

parent[chamber] = None for all chambers.

deque.append(entrance)

Iteration:

while deque is not empty:
    current_chamber = deque.popleft()

    for neighbor_chamber in graph[current_chamber]:
        cost = 1 if neighbor_chamber in collapsed else 0

        if dist[current_chamber] + cost < dist[neighbor_chamber]:
            dist[neighbor_chamber] = dist[current_chamber] + cost
            parent[neighbor_chamber] = current_chamber

            if cost == 0:
                deque.appendleft(neighbor_chamber)  // Add to front for priority
            else:
                deque.append(neighbor_chamber)     // Add to back

Use code with caution.

Path Reconstruction:

if dist[crystal_chamber] == infinity:
    print("No path exists.")
else:
    path = []
    current = crystal_chamber
    while current is not None:
        path.append(current)
        current = parent[current]

    path.reverse()
    print("Path:", path)
    print("Dynamite needed:", dist[crystal_chamber])

Use code with caution.

Explanation:

0-1 BFS: A standard BFS uses a queue. In 0-1 BFS, we use a deque (double-ended queue). When we encounter an edge with cost 0 (tunnel), we add the neighbor to the front of the deque. This prioritizes exploration along zero-cost edges, ensuring that we find the shortest path. If we encounter an edge with cost 1 (collapsed chamber), we add the neighbor to the back of the deque.

Cost Calculation: The cost variable represents the amount of dynamite needed to cross from the current_chamber to the neighbor_chamber.

Path Reconstruction: If a path exists (dist[crystal_chamber] != infinity), we can reconstruct the path by starting at the crystal chamber and following the parent pointers back to the entrance.

Space Complexity: The algorithm requires O(V) space to store the distances and the parent map.

Optimality (O(V+E) Complexity):

Standard BFS has O(V+E) complexity.

The 0-1 BFS also has O(V+E) complexity. Each chamber is added to and removed from the deque at most once. The operations with the list such as list.contains do not influence the complexity, assuming that it takes constant time.

Because of these operations, 0-1 BFS is optimal.

This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path from the entrance to the crystal chamber, minimizing the amount of dynamite needed.
