I'll provide the solution for each task in detail.

**Task 1:**
To find a connected bipartite induced subgraph with the maximum number of nodes and a bipartition of it, we can use the following approach:

1. Start with an arbitrary node, say node 1.
2. Perform a BFS traversal starting from node 1.
3. During the traversal, assign each node a color (either red or blue) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
4. Continue the traversal until all nodes are visited.
5. The resulting colored graph is a bipartite graph.

For the given graph, we can start with node 1 and perform a BFS traversal. We assign node 1 the color red. Then, we visit node 2 and assign it the color blue. We continue this process until all nodes are visited. The resulting bipartite graph has the following bipartition:

Red: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
Blue: {2, 4, 6, 8}

This bipartite graph has the maximum number of nodes.

**Task 2:**
To illustrate how breadth-first search (BFS) works, let's consider the graph and start with node 4.

1. Create a queue and enqueue node 4.
2. Mark node 4 as visited.
3. Dequeue node 4 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (nodes 3 and 8).
4. Mark nodes 3 and 8 as visited.
5. Dequeue node 3 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 5).
6. Mark nodes 1, 2, and 5 as visited.
7. Dequeue node 8 and enqueue its unvisited neighbor (node 9).
8. Mark node 9 as visited.
9. Dequeue node 9 and enqueue its unvisited neighbor (node 7).
10. Mark node 7 as visited.

The BFS traversal order is: 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 5, 9, 7, 6

We can use BFS to calculate the distance from node 4 to all other nodes. The distance from node 4 to a node is the minimum number of edges between them.

| Node | Distance from Node 4 |
| --- | --- |
| 1    | 2                   |
| 2    | 2                   |
| 3    | 1                   |
| 5    | 2                   |
| 6    | 3                   |
| 7    | 3                   |
| 8    | 1                   |
| 9    | 2                   |

The BFS tree rooted at node 4 is:

        4
       / \
      3   8
     / \   \
    1   2   9
   / \   \
  5   6   7

**Task 3:**
To determine if the graph has an Eulerian path, we need to check if all nodes have even degrees. If a node has an odd degree, we need to remove an edge incident to it to make its degree even.

In the given graph, nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7 have odd degrees. We can remove the edges (1, 3), (3, 5), and (5, 7) to make their degrees even.

The resulting graph has an Eulerian path: 1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 5

A necessary and sufficient condition for an undirected graph to have an Eulerian path is that at most two nodes have odd degrees.

**Task 4:**
To find the critical nodes of the graph, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Perform a DFS traversal of the graph and assign each node a low value (the smallest reachable ancestor).
2. For each node, check if it is a cut vertex (i.e., its removal increases the number of connected components).
3. If a node is a cut vertex, mark it as critical.

Using this algorithm, we can find the critical nodes of the graph.

**Task 5:**
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the distance matrix D with the cost matrix.
2. For each node j, update the distance matrix D as follows:
   for i = 1 to n do
       for k = 1 to n do
           D[i, k] = min(D[i, k], D[i, j] + D[j, k])

Let's apply the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to the given graph.

Initial distance matrix D:

|  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |

| 9  | ∞  | ∞  | ∞  | ∞  | ∞  | ∞  | 5  | 6  | 0  |

**Task 6:**
To illustrate Prim's algorithm, let's start with node 4.

1. Create a set S containing node 4.
2. Create a set T containing all other nodes.
3. Find the minimum-weight edge (4, 3) and add it to the minimum spanning tree (MST).
4. Move node 3 from T to S.
5. Find the minimum-weight edge (3, 1) and add it to the MST.
6. Move node 1 from T to S.
7. Find the minimum-weight edge (1, 2) and add it to the MST.
8. Move node 2 from T to S.
9. Find the minimum-weight edge (2, 6) and add it to the MST.
10. Move node 6 from T to S.
11. Find the minimum-weight edge (6, 5) and add it to the MST.
12. Move node 5 from T to S.
13. Find the minimum-weight edge (5, 7) and add it to the MST.
14. Move node 7 from T to S.
15. Find the minimum-weight edge (7, 9) and add it to the MST.
16. Move node 9 from T to S.
17. Find the minimum-weight edge (9, 8) and add it to the MST.

The resulting MST has the following edges:

(4, 3), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 5), (5, 7), (7, 9), (9, 8)

**Task 7:**
The algorithm for determining a minimum spanning tree of a connected weighted graph G = (V, E, w) is correct.

Justification:

1. The algorithm starts with an arbitrary node and adds it to the set S.
2. It then finds the minimum-weight edge incident to a node in S and adds it to the MST.
3. The algorithm continues this process until all nodes are in S.
4. The resulting MST is a tree because it is connected and has no cycles.
5. The MST is minimum because the algorithm always chooses the minimum-weight edge incident to a node in S.

**Task 8:**
To illustrate the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, let's start with the given flow and choose an s-t f-unsaturated path of minimum length at each step.

Initial flow:

| Edge | Flow/Capacity |
| --- | --- |
| (1, 2) | 5/5 |
| (1, 5) | 6/6 |
| (4, 2) | 3/3 |
| (5, 4) | 0/0 |
| (6, 4) | 3/3 |
| (2, 6) | 8/8 |
| (3, 6) | 3/3 |
| (5, 3) | 6/6 |
| (6, 7) | 8/8 |
| (3, 7) | 3/3 |

Step 1:

* Choose the path 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 7
* Augment the flow along this path by 1 unit

Updated flow:

| Edge | Flow/Capacity |
| --- | --- |
| (1, 2) | 5/5 |
| (1, 5) | 7/6 |
| (4, 2) | 3/3 |
| (5, 4) | 1/0 |
| (6, 4) | 3/3 |
| (2, 6) | 8/8 |
| (3, 6) | 3/3 |
| (5, 3) | 6/6 |
| (6, 7) | 9/8 |
| (3, 7) | 3/3 |

Step 2:

* Choose the path 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7
* Augment the flow along this path by 1 unit

Updated flow:

| Edge | Flow/Capacity |
| --- | --- |
| (1, 2) | 5/5 |
| (1, 5) | 8/6 |
| (4, 2) | 3/3 |
| (5, 4) | 1/0 |
| (6, 4) | 3/3 |
| (2, 6) | 8/8 |
| (3, 6) | 4/3 |
| (5, 3) | 7/6 |
| (6, 7) | 10/8 |
| (3, 7) | 3/3 |

Step 3:

* Choose the path 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 7
* Augment the flow along this path by 1 unit

Updated flow:

| Edge | Flow/Capacity |
| --- | --- |
| (1, 2) | 5/5 |
| (1, 5) | 9/6 |
| (4, 2) | 3/3 |
| (5, 4) | 1/0 |
| (6, 4) | 3/3 |
| (2, 6) | 8/8 |
| (3, 6) | 4/3 |
| (5, 3) | 8/6 |
| (6, 7) | 10/8 |
| (3, 7) | 4/3 |

The algorithm terminates because there is no s-t f-unsaturated path.

The minimum cut is:

* S = {1, 5, 3, 7}
* T = {2, 4, 6}

The capacity of this cut is:

* (1, 2) = 5
* (5, 4) = 0
* (3, 6) = 3
* (5, 3) = 6
* (3, 7) = 3

Total capacity = 5 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 17

**Task 9:**

a. Show that a graph with n > 2 nodes that satisfies the condition d(x) >= n/2 for any node x is connected.

Proof:

Assume the graph is not connected. Then, there exist two nodes x and y that are not connected by a path.

Since d(x) >= n/2, x has at least n/2 neighbors.

Similarly, since d(y) >= n/2, y has at least n/2 neighbors.

Since x and y are not connected by a path, they do not have any common neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of nodes in the graph is at least n/2 + n/2 + 2 = n + 2, which is a contradiction.

Hence, the graph is connected.

b. Give an example of a non-Hamiltonian graph in which there are two distinct non-adjacent nodes with the sum of degrees greater than or equal to n.

Example:

Consider a graph with 5 nodes: A, B, C, D, and E.

The edges are: (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, E), and (E, A).

The degrees of the nodes are:

* A: 2
* B: 2
* C: 2
* D: 2
* E: 2

The sum of the degrees of nodes A and C is 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than or equal to 5.

However, the graph is not Hamiltonian because there is no cycle that visits all nodes.

c. Show that if a graph G with n >= 2 nodes has m >= combinations(n-1, 2) + 2 edges, then G is Hamiltonian.

Proof:

Assume G is not Hamiltonian.

Then, there exists a node x such that G - x is not connected.

Let y and z be two nodes in different components of G - x.

Since G has m >= combinations(n-1, 2) + 2 edges, the number of edges in G - x is at least combinations(n-2, 2) + 1.

By Ore's theorem, G - x has a Hamiltonian cycle.

This cycle must contain the edge (y, z), which is a contradiction.

Hence, G is Hamiltonian.

**Task 10:**
To find the maximum length of a common subsequence of two words, we can use dynamic programming.

Let's consider the words "cerceta" and "retea".

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum length of a common subsequence of the first i characters of "cerceta" and the first j characters of "retea".

Initialize the array dp as follows:

|  |  | r | e | t | e | a |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| c | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| e | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| r | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| c | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| e | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| t | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| a | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |

The maximum length of a common subsequence is dp[7][5] = 4.

The common subsequence is "reta".

**Task 11:**
To find the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.

Let's consider the graph with nodes A, B, C, D, and E, and edges with weights as follows:

* (A, B): 2
* (A, C): 3
* (B, D): 1
* (C, D): 2
* (D, E): 3

Create a priority queue Q containing all nodes with their distances from the source node A.

| Node | Distance |
| --- | --- |
| A    | 0       |
| B    | ∞       |
| C    | ∞       |
| D    | ∞       |
| E    | ∞       |

Extract the node with the minimum distance from Q, which is A.

Update the distances of the neighbors of A:

| Node | Distance |
| --- | --- |
| A    | 0       |
| B    | 2       |
| C    | 3       |
| D    | ∞       |
| E    | ∞       |

Extract the node with the minimum distance from Q, which is B.

Update the distances of the neighbors of B:

| Node | Distance |
| --- | --- |
| A    | 0       |
| B    | 2       |
| C    | 3       |
| D    | 3       |
| E    | ∞       |

Extract the node with the minimum distance from Q, which is C.

Update the distances of the neighbors of C:

| Node | Distance |
| --- | --- |
| A    | 0       |
| B    | 2       |
| C    | 3       |
| D    | 3       |
| E    | ∞       |

Extract the node with the minimum distance from Q, which is D.

Update the distances of the neighbors of D:

| Node | Distance |
| --- | --- |
| A    | 0       |
| B    | 2       |
| C    | 3       |
| D    | 3       |
| E    | 6       |

The shortest path from A to E is A -> B -> D -> E with a total weight of 6.
