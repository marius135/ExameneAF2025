1. Finding maximum bipartite induced subgraph:

Let's analyze the graph to find the largest bipartite induced subgraph. I'll use a coloring approach.

The largest bipartite induced subgraph consists of:
- Set A: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Set B: {2, 4, 8}

This is a connected bipartite subgraph with 7 vertices. We can verify it's bipartite because:
- All edges connect vertices from different sets
- The subgraph is connected
- No larger connected bipartite subgraph exists (vertices 5 and 6 can't be added without breaking the bipartite property)

2. BFS from vertex 4:

Let me provide a step-by-step BFS execution from vertex 4:

```
Initial state: 
Queue: [4]
Distances: d[4] = 0, all others infinity
Visited: {4}

Step 1:
Process 4 -> Add neighbors (3, 5, 8)
Queue: [3, 5, 8]
Distances: d[3] = 1, d[5] = 1, d[8] = 1
Visited: {3, 4, 5, 8}

Step 2:
Process 3 -> Add neighbors (1, 2, 6)
Queue: [5, 8, 1, 2, 6]
Distances: d[1] = 2, d[2] = 2, d[6] = 2
Visited: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Step 3:
Process remaining vertices, adding 7, 9
Final distances from 4:
d[1] = 2
d[2] = 2
d[3] = 1
d[4] = 0
d[5] = 1
d[6] = 2
d[7] = 2
d[8] = 1
d[9] = 2
```

The BFS tree:
```
        4
     /  |  \
    3   5   8
   /|\      |\
  1 2 6     7 9
```



3. Eulerian Path:
For an undirected graph to have an Eulerian path, either:
- All vertices have even degree, or
- Exactly two vertices have odd degree (these will be the endpoints)

Let's count vertex degrees:
1: degree 2
2: degree 3
3: degree 5
4: degree 3
5: degree 2
6: degree 2
7: degree 2
8: degree 3
9: degree 2

We have five vertices with odd degree (2, 3, 4, 8), so the graph doesn't have an Eulerian path. To obtain a graph with an Eulerian path, we need to remove edges to leave exactly two vertices with odd degree. 

Strategy: Remove edge (2,3) and edge (3,4). This leaves:
- Vertex 3 with odd degree
- Vertex 4 with odd degree
- All other vertices with even degree

An Eulerian path in the modified graph: 4-5-3-1-2-6-3-5-4-8-7-9-8

4. Critical Nodes:
A critical node (articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components.

Algorithm to find critical nodes:
```python
def find_critical_nodes(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    discovery = [0] * n
    low = [0] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    critical = set()
    time = [0]
    
    def dfs(u, parent):
        children = 0
        visited[u] = True
        discovery[u] = low[u] = time[0]
        time[0] += 1
        
        for v in graph[u]:
            if not visited[v]:
                children += 1
                dfs(v, u)
                low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])
                
                if parent == -1 and children > 1:
                    critical.add(u)
                if parent != -1 and low[v] >= discovery[u]:
                    critical.add(u)
            elif v != parent:
                low[u] = min(low[u], discovery[v])
    
    dfs(0, -1)
    return critical
```

Critical nodes in our graph: {3, 8}
- Node 3 is critical because its removal disconnects vertices 5,4 from 1,2,6
- Node 8 is critical because its removal disconnects 7,9 from the rest

5. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:

The missing line in the algorithm is:
```
D[i,k] = min(D[i,k], D[i,j] + D[j,k])
```

Initial distance matrix D (showing first few stages):
```
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
1 0  1  4  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞
2 1  0  2  ∞  ∞  10 ∞  ∞  ∞
3 4  2  0  5  12 11 ∞  ∞  ∞
4 ∞  ∞  5  0  1  ∞  ∞  3  ∞
5 ∞  ∞  12 1  0  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞
6 ∞  10 11 ∞  ∞  0  ∞  ∞  ∞
7 ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  0  2  5
8 ∞  ∞  ∞  3  ∞  ∞  2  0  6
9 ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  5  6  0
```

After j=1 (first vertex), j=2, and j=3 the matrix gets updated with shorter paths through these intermediate vertices.

6. Prim's Algorithm starting from vertex 4:

Steps of Prim's algorithm:
1. Start with vertex 4
2. Add edge (4,5) weight 1
3. Add edge (4,8) weight 3
4. Add edge (4,3) weight 5
5. Add edge (8,7) weight 2
6. Add edge (8,9) weight 6
7. Add edge (3,2) weight 2
8. Add edge (3,1) weight 4
9. Add edge (2,6) weight 10

Final MST weight = 33

7. The proposed algorithm is incorrect.

Counter-example:
Consider a graph with vertices {1,2,3} and edges:
(1,2) weight 10
(2,3) weight 1
(1,3) weight 2

The algorithm would:
1. Start with vertex 1, choose edge (1,2) as it's the only option
2. Already have all vertices connected

This produces a tree with weight 10, while the optimal MST has weight 3 using edges (1,3) and (2,3).

The algorithm fails because it restricts edge selection to components containing specific vertices in order, rather than always choosing the global minimum weight edge that connects any two components.

8. Ford-Fulkerson (Edmonds-Karp variant):

Steps:
1. Find shortest augmenting path: 1-5-4-2-6-7
   Flow increase: min(1,0,3,8,8) = 0 (path already saturated)
2. Find next path: 1-5-3-7
   Flow increase: min(6-6,6-6,3-3) = 0 (path already saturated)
3. No more augmenting paths exist

Minimum cut:
S = {1,5,3,4}
T = {2,6,7}
Cut capacity = sum of capacities of forward edges - sum of backward flow = 22

9. Graph Theory Proofs:

a) Proof for d(x) ≥ n/2:
- For any two vertices x,y, their neighborhoods must overlap
- Because d(x) + d(y) > n, by pigeonhole principle
- This means any two vertices are connected by path of length ≤ 2
- Therefore graph is connected

b) Example of non-Hamiltonian graph:
- Take K5,5 (complete bipartite graph)
- It has n=10 vertices
- Any two non-adjacent vertices have degree sum 10
- But it's not Hamiltonian (bipartite with unequal parts)

c) Proof for m ≥ C(n-1,2) + 2:
- By Bondy-Chvátal theorem
- Such density ensures closure has a Hamiltonian cycle
- Number of edges ensures all non-adjacent vertices have degree sum ≥ n
- Therefore graph is Hamiltonian

10. Longest Common Subsequence:

Algorithm uses dynamic programming:
```
LCS[i,j] = 0 if i=0 or j=0
LCS[i,j] = LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 if x[i]=y[j]
LCS[i,j] = max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) otherwise
```

For "cerceta" and "retea":
```
    r  e  t  e  a
c   0  0  0  0  0
e   0  1  1  1  1
r   1  1  1  1  1
c   1  1  1  1  1
e   1  2  2  2  2
t   1  2  3  3  3
a   1  2  3  3  4
```

11. Mine Explorer Problem:

This is essentially a modified shortest path problem where the "cost" is the number of dynamite needed.


def find_best_path(chambers, tunnels, start, end, collapsed):
    import heapq
    
    # Priority queue storing (dynamite_used, chamber)
    pq = [(0, start)]
    # Keep track of minimum dynamite needed to reach each chamber
    min_dynamite = {start: 0}
    # Keep track of path
    previous = {start: None}
    
    while pq:
        dynamite, current = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if current == end:
            # Reconstruct path
            path = []
            while current:
                path.append(current)
                current = previous[current]
            return dynamite, path[::-1]
            
        for next_chamber in tunnels[current]:
            new_dynamite = dynamite
            if next_chamber in collapsed:
                new_dynamite += 1
                
            if (next_chamber not in min_dynamite or 
                new_dynamite < min_dynamite[next_chamber]):
                min_dynamite[next_chamber] = new_dynamite
                previous[next_chamber] = current
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dynamite, next_chamber))
    
    return None, None  # No path exists
```

The algorithm uses Dijkstra's algorithm with modifications:
- Edge weights are 0 for normal chambers, 1 for collapsed chambers
- Priority queue orders by minimum dynamite used
- Complexity: O((V+E)log V) where V is number of chambers and E is number of tunnels
