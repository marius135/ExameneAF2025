Problem 1: Connected bipartite induced subgraph with maximum number of nodes and its bipartition
Looking at the criteria, we need to:

Find the maximal connected bipartite subgraph
Provide its bipartition

The correct answer, according to the examples, would be:

Subgraph: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
Bipartition:

A = {1, 4, 6, 9}
B = {3, 8}



This is optimal because:

It's bipartite - we can verify that all edges connect nodes from set A to set B
It's connected - there is a path between any two nodes in the subgraph
It's maximal - we cannot add any more nodes while maintaining the bipartite property

Problem 2: BFS Exploration and Distance Calculation
Starting from node 4, the BFS exploration would proceed as follows:

BFS Order: 4 → 3 → 5 → 8 → 1 → 2 → 6 → 7 → 9
Distances from node 4 to all other nodes:

[∞, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2] (for nodes 0-9)


BFS Tree:

          4
       /   |   \
      3    5    8
     /|\       | \
    1 2 6      7  9
Problem 3: Eulerian Chain in Graph

Condition verification:

A graph has an Eulerian chain if and only if it has exactly 0 or 2 nodes of odd degree and is connected.


Minimum edge removal:

Need to identify odd degree nodes
Remove edge (3,4) to get exactly 2 odd vertices (2 and 8)


Eulerian Chain example after edge removal:
2→1→3→2→6→3→5→4→8→7→9→8

Problem 4: Critical Nodes (Articulation Points) using DFS

DFS visiting order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 8 → 7 → 9 → 6
Back edges: 3→1, 6→2, 9→8
Critical nodes: 3, 4, and 8

Node 3 is critical because child 4 has low[4] ≥ disc[3]
Node 4 is critical as it separates components
Node 8 is critical as it connects to node 9



Problem 5: Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

Basic idea:

for k in range(1, n+1):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            D[i][j] = min(D[i][j], D[i][k] + D[k][j])

Matrix D evolution after steps k=1,2,3 would show the progressive improvement in shortest paths.

Problem 6: Prim's Algorithm
Starting from node 4:

Add edge (4,5) - cost 1
Add edge (4,8) - cost 3
Add edge (8,7) - cost 2
Add edge (7,9) - cost 5
Add edge (3,4) - cost 5
Add edge (2,3) - cost 2
Add edge (1,2) - cost 1
Add edge (6,2) - cost 10

Total MST cost = 29
Problem 7: Justification of MST Algorithm

Algorithm idea:

Start with empty tree T
For each i from 1 to |V|-1
Add cheapest edge connecting component containing i to external node


Justification (Cut Property):

At each step, the chosen edge is the minimum crossing a cut
This ensures global optimality through local choices
Can be proved by contradiction



Problem 8: Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

Steps to increase flow:

Path 1: 1 → 2 → 6 → 7 (flow +1)
Path 2: 1 → 2 → 4 → 6 → 7 (flow +1)
Path 3: 1 → 2 → 4 → 6 → 3 → 7 (flow +2)


Final flow = 4 units
Minimum cut:

S = {1, 2, 4}
T = {3, 5, 6, 7}



Problem 9: Ore's Theorem
a) Graph connectivity proof:

Given: For any node x, d(x) ≥ n/2
Proof by contradiction: If graph were disconnected, any node in smaller component would have degree < n/2

b) Non-Hamiltonian graph example:

Complete bipartite graph K2,3
Nodes u,v from different partitions have d(u) + d(v) ≥ n but graph isn't Hamiltonian

c) Ore's Theorem proof sketch (partial):

If d(u) + d(v) ≥ n for all non-adjacent vertices
Then graph must contain Hamiltonian cycle
Proof by contradiction using path extensions

Problem 10: Longest Common Subsequence
For strings "cerceta" and "retea":
DP Matrix (showing final values):
    r e t e a
  0 0 0 0 0 0
c 0 0 0 0 0 0
e 0 0 1 1 1 1
r 0 1 1 1 1 1
c 0 1 1 1 1 1
e 0 1 2 2 2 2
t 0 1 2 3 3 3
a 0 1 2 3 3 4
Longest common subsequence: "reta" (length 4)
Problem 11: Underground Mine - Path with Minimum Dynamite

Optimal Solution (0-1 BFS):

Use deque for frontier
Add cost 0 edges to front
Add cost 1 edges to back
Complexity: O(V + E)


Alternative (Dijkstra):

Use priority queue
Edge weights 0/1 for tunnels/collapsed rooms
Complexity: O(E log V)



Both approaches work, but 0-1 BFS is more efficient for this specific case.
